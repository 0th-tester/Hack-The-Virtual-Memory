# Hack the Virtual Memory

This is a series of small articles / tutorials based around virtual memory. The goal is to learn some CS basics, but in a different and more practical way.

## TOC

### 00. C strings & /proc

For this first piece, we'll use `/proc` to find and modify variables (in this example, an ASCII string) contained inside the virtual memory of a running process, and learn some cool things along the way.

### 01. Python bytes

For this second piece, we do almost the same thing, but instead we access the virtual memory of a running Python 3 script. It is not as straightfoward. Let's take this as an excuse to look at some Python 3 internals!

### 02. What's where in the virtual memory

Let's try to guess where things are in the virtual memory.

### 03. TBA

_Working on it_
